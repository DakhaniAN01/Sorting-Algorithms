Bubble Sort is a algorithm in which adjacent elements are compared and swapped according to the condition.
This procees of comparing and swapping for each element untill all the elements are sorted.
Time Complexity : O(N^2)
Space Complexity : O(1)
Bubble Sort is an easy to implement algorithm.
It works well with small data set.
Due to time complexity O(N^2) dealing with large data set is bad.
